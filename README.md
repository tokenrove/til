A place to collect non-earth-shattering notes on things I learned, or
possibly relearned.  Probably things that are too small for a blog
post, but enough hassle to rediscover that they're worth collecting
somewhere.

These things might be obvious to other people.  Indeed, some entries I
have in mind come from someone telling me "obviously, ...".
